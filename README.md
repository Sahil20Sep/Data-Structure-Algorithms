## Introduction

This repository is a collection of various data structures and algorithms implemented in different programming languages. It is intended for educational purposes and serves as a reference for those who want to learn and practice data structures and algorithms.

## Data Structures

### Arrays

Arrays are a fundamental data structure consisting of a collection of elements, each identified by an array index.

- [Array Implementation](./arrays/array_implementation.md)
- [Array Operations](./arrays/array_operations.md)

### Linked Lists

Linked lists are a linear data structure where each element is a separate object, linked using pointers.

- [Singly Linked List](./linked_lists/singly_linked_list.md)
- [Doubly Linked List](./linked_lists/doubly_linked_list.md)

### Stacks

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.

- [Stack Implementation](./stacks/stack_implementation.md)
- [Stack Operations](./stacks/stack_operations.md)

### Queues

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.

- [Queue Implementation](./queues/queue_implementation.md)
- [Queue Operations](./queues/queue_operations.md)

### Trees

Trees are hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes, with a single node as the root.

- [Binary Tree](./trees/binary_tree.md)
- [Binary Search Tree](./trees/binary_search_tree.md)
- [AVL Tree](./trees/avl_tree.md)

### Graphs

Graphs are a collection of nodes connected by edges.

- [Graph Representation](./graphs/graph_representation.md)
- [Graph Traversals](./graphs/graph_traversals.md)

### Heaps

A heap is a special tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.

- [Min Heap](./heaps/min_heap.md)
- [Max Heap](./heaps/max_heap.md)

### Hash Tables

A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values for highly efficient lookup.

- [Hash Table Implementation](./hash_tables/hash_table_implementation.md)
- [Collision Handling](./hash_tables/collision_handling.md)

## Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms are used to arrange data in a particular order.

- [Bubble Sort](./sorting_algorithms/bubble_sort.md)
- [Merge Sort](./sorting_algorithms/merge_sort.md)
- [Quick Sort](./sorting_algorithms/quick_sort.md)

### Searching Algorithms

Searching algorithms are designed to retrieve information stored within some data structure.

- [Linear Search](./searching_algorithms/linear_search.md)
- [Binary Search](./searching_algorithms/binary_search.md)

### Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.

- [Fibonacci Series](./dynamic_programming/fibonacci_series.md)
- [Knapsack Problem](./dynamic_programming/knapsack_problem.md)

### Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step to find a global optimum.

- [Activity Selection](./greedy_algorithms/activity_selection.md)
- [Huffman Coding](./greedy_algorithms/huffman_coding.md)

### Graph Algorithms

Graph algorithms are used to solve problems related to graph theory.

- [Dijkstra's Algorithm](./graph_algorithms/dijkstras_algorithm.md)
- [Kruskal's Algorithm](./graph_algorithms/kruskals_algorithm.md)

### Backtracking

Backtracking is a method for finding all (or some) solutions to computational problems.

- [N-Queens Problem](./backtracking/n_queens_problem.md)
- [Sudoku Solver](./backtracking/sudoku_solver.md)
